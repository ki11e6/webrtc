# 03. WebRTC History & Core Concepts

## A Brief History
-   **2011**: First draft specification introduced.
-   **Feb 2013**: First cross-browser video call achieved between **Firefox** and **Chrome**.
    -   Demonstrated that WebRTC functionality is baked into the browser (no plugins required).
-   **2021**: Official standard released (though the technology was widely used long before this).

## Core Concepts & Workflow
Even early implementations (circa 2013) used the same core APIs and logic we use today.

### The Roles
-   **Caller (Initiator)**: Starts the connection process.
-   **Receiver**: Accepts the incoming connection.
-   **Shared Codebase**: Typically, the same application code handles both roles depending on user action.

### Key APIs & Functions
1.  **`getUserMedia()`**:
    -   Used to access the device's media streams (video/audio).
2.  **`RTCPeerConnection`**:
    -   The central object used to establish and manage the P2P connection.
    -   Media streams are added to this connection.
3.  **Signaling (The Handshake)**:
    -   **`createOffer()`**: Generated by the Caller. Contains information about media and capabilities.
    -   **`createAnswer()`**: Generated by the Receiver in response to an offer.
    -   **`setLocalDescription()` / `setRemoteDescription()`**: Both sides must tell their `RTCPeerConnection` about themselves (local) and their peer (remote).
4.  **Exchange Mechanism**:
    -   Offers and Answers are exchanged via a signaling mechanism (e.g., AJAX, WebSockets) which acts as the "middleman" only for this setup phase.
5.  **Termination**:
    -   `close()`: Method to end the connection on the `RTCPeerConnection` object.
